      <ul className="ui list">
        <li>You have <strong>5</strong> votes</li>
        <li>You can apply multiple votes to a given idea</li>
        <li>Voting is blind. Totals will be revealed when the facilitator advances the retro.</li>
        <li>Once a vote has been cast, there's no taking it back, so vote carefully!</li>
