Hi! This file would normally be the entry-point for the CSS in your phoenix app.
In our case, it isn't! We use Semantic UI for the majority of our styling, and
leverage CSS modules where we need to do any custom styling. CSS modules are
better than excellent, and, if you've never used them, will make your life better
by leaps and bounds. Look em up! Use em!
