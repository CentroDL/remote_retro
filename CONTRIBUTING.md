# Introduction

### Greetings, contributor!

Thank you for considering contributing to Remote Retro. We're happy to have you!

### Types of contributions we're looking for

The best way to contribute is to take a look at our current backlog and work on a story that you're most excited about. Please take a look at the [Project Management](https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro#project-management) section of our Readme for viewing the backlog. Bug fixes and documentation improvements are also welcome.

# Code of Conduct
Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

# First time contributing?
Unsure where to begin contributing to Remote Retro? You can start by looking through issues that have the "beginner-friendly" or "help wanted" label.

# Getting started
### Give them a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.
Please see the [Dev Environment Setup](https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro#dev-environment-setup) and [Tests](https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro#tests) sections of the Readme.

* Let them know if they need to sign a CLA, agree to a DCO, or get any other legal stuff out of the way
* If tests are required for contributions, let them know, and explain how to run the tests
* If you use anything other than GitHub to manage issues (ex. JIRA or Trac), let them know which tools theyâ€™ll need to contribute

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the jQuery Foundation.
    * Note the jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

# How to report a bug
### Security issues
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

### How to file a bug report.
Please open an issue and use the template provided. Please add the "Bug" label.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
Before suggesting a feature, please read through the [Roadmap to MVP](https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro#roadmap-to-mvp) and check the backlog to make sure that the story doesn't exist already. Once you're ready to suggest the feature or enhancement, open an issue and use the provided template. Please also add the "feature request" label.

# Code review process
After you submit your pull request, it will be reviewed within 5 business days and we will give you feedback on any needed changes.
After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community
If there are other channels you use besides GitHub to discuss contributions, mention them here. You can also list the author, maintainers, and/or contributors here, or set expectations for response time.

> You can chat with the core team on https://gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber. We try to have office hours on Fridays.

# Code Style
ESLint is used for checking JavaScript code style. It is also useful for avoiding some errors. Please use indentation of 2 spaces, and no semicolons.
Please use ES2015.
